	<h2>Web Developer Portfolio Website and Business Cards</h2>

		<p>For this website, I teamed up with a web developer colleague of mine in need of rebranding. He liked fractals and patterns that were futuristic and technical, which inspired me to choose the stock photo shown on the splash page and use a different edited rendition for each succeeding content area. This simple one page website utilizes Bootstrap styling for navigation and responsiveness and normalize.css for a consistent brand accross browsers. In designing this website I learned how to use git as an organized way to manage my progress.</p>

		<p>I decided to integrate what my colleague does into the look of the business card with a little attitude. The same stock photo used for the splash page of the website fills the back with UV coating. The front is an illustration of a JSON object, colors pulled from the image. My main challenge was ensuring all letters were legible swimming in a sea of black on such a small canvas-a risk I wanted to take and a decision I do not take lightly.</p>

	<h2>Event Advertising Campaign Poster and Facebook Banner</h2>

		<p>This advertising campaign's goal was to draw people to Champaign Urbana Books to Prisoners' ten year anniversary celebration. Since my volunteer team and I were a rather eclectic group and we were planning this event to take place at the Independent Media Center, which also is locally known for its multifaceted interior style, Alice in Wonderland was brought up quickly as an appropriate theme.</p>

		<p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Aliquam iaculis fringilla ante, vel pellentesque ante rhoncus vitae. Donec molestie massa risus, a tincidunt odio egestas non. Mauris sit amet eros accumsan, posuere leo sed, rutrum sapien. Praesent sit amet lacus a orci pellentesque commodo id id enim. Praesent libero lorem, bibendum id dictum a, varius eu metus. Nam ut tortor volutpat, tempor ipsum at, egestas est.</p>

	<h2>Fishing Lure Packaging and Business Cards</h2>

		<p>I was hired by do good Consulting to create a package and business card style that reflected the personality of the client, who was well known in his rural town for his gorgeous handmade fishing lures.</p>

		<p>This client had a longtime mowing and landscaping buisness called PrimeTime. The logo was PrimeTyme, with the "y" being utilized as a hand on a clock, which was behind the word. The logo had been hand drawn and could have used an update. Since the client was expanding his business to include selling fishing lures, I suggested using the "y" as a lure instead. It was agreed then that a fishing lure logo would be used for lures and the clock logo would be used for his other services. I polished the logo by creating clean lines and taking inspiration from sports logos.</p>

		<p>With this special project, my challenge was creating deliverables that had dynamic style but that could be printed with one ink color. I chose the wood background to give the packaging and business card a rustic feel, completed the layout. Then, I took out all color and used the monotone option in Photoshop. I showed several color options to the client and he eventually chose a pastel green. With different levels of opaqueness, this green actually lent a large range of intensity and was legible.</p>

	<h2>Business Card</h2>

		<p>VisionLink is a social media outlet designed to get peopole talking about and solving social, economic and environmental sustainability issues without bipartisan politics getting in the way. This site may have been launched in Champaign Urbana, but the President hopes for the community to spread worldwide and bring real change. You may check out VisionLink at www.visionlink.vision.</p>

		<p>I tightened the original VisionLink logo by updating the font and creating a symmetrical arc of the dots, which indicate connections and movement. Then I used a stock photo of the earth to reflect this web community's broad reaching and eventual goals. This business card is a good example of the real purpose of branding-not to show who a company or organization is today but who a company or organization is tomorrow.</p>

	<h2>Event Advertising Poster</h2>

		<p>Twice a year, Parkland College art students create beautiful ceramic bowls to be used for a fundraising event to fund the Eastern Illinois Food Bank. This advertising poster, which hung at Silvercreek and The Courier.</p>

		<p>I shot a couple hundred photos of heaps of bowls. Honestly, that was probably the most fun part of this project! Then I chose the most dynamic photo that highlighted one bowl with coloful swirls at the bottom. For the layout, I chose a dark overlay that was opaque enough for the type to be legible but translucent enough to show the outlines of the other bowls if you look closely. Vector swirls echoed the swirl in the bowl.</p>

<h1>About Me</h1>

	<p>Hello, I'm Kelly. Thank you for checking out my online portfolio.</p>

	<p>I could draw since I could hold a crayon. Watching Nick at Night before bed as a kid, I dreamed of doing what Darren from Bewitched did as a career. Remember him? He was a Commercial Artist. He would draw up these cheesy commercials on large boards, show them to his boss and his boss would say how lousy they were. Darren's boss's reaction didn't bother me-I knew I wanted to do that!</p>

	<p>It is my belief that in society we solve problems in strengthening and crystallizing our brand. I practice a holistic approach to graphic design and advertising, seeking first to understand the "who" before getting to the "how," and through my aestetic decisions bringing out the history and future growth of my client simultaneously.</p> 

	<p>I hope to one day change the world through my professional, yet quirky advertising. In the meantime, however, I am available for a company that needs a team player with an eye for detail and keen focus on the client's needs.</p>

<h1>Contact Me</h1>
	<p>I look forward to meeting you!</p>
